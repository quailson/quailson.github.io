The latest and greatest in embedded linux systems. Just working out a few kinks in the final PCB so we can get back on track with our fab. Here's a sneak preview of the potential final version.

For a potential later version, I'd like to remove the impedance matching resistors by moving the RAM closer. For such a small distance and relatively low speed, it should be doable without too many hiccups. Hell, it may not even need length matching, but that's no fun (and also probably just a bad idea).

Shouts out to [Thomas](http://obnauticus.com/).
