Tonight, my roommate and I made risotto. It was loosely based off of [this recipe from Anson Mills](http://www.ansonmills.com/recipes/406). They describe it as "A side dish that knows no peers," but we wanted a risotto more suitable for dinner plate, so we just threw in tomatoes and fresh basil at the last second because it sounded substantial enough. Here's our recipe.

## Tomato Basil Risotto

    * 4 cups of chicken broth
    * 2 tablespoons of butter
    * 2 tablespoons of olive oil
    * 3 finely diced shallots
    * 3 cloves worth of minced garlic
    * 1 cup of rice (we used Carolina Gold, but Arborio should work fine)
    * around 1/2 cup of cheap Pinot Grigio
    * couple sprigs worth of thyme and rosemary
    * couple bay leaves
    * sea salt to taste (your chicken broth might have enough salt on its own)
    * ground black pepper (we had black peppercorns that we're soaked in a port wine)
    * freshly grated parmesan
    * 1 cup of cherry tomatoes
    * 1/2 cup of fresh basil

    1. Heat the stock in a small pot on medium for a bit. Leave it on the side for now.
    2. In a larger pot on medium heat, add butter, shallots, and garlic. Cook until golden. Add rice and a little olive oil. Stir around for a few minutes.
    3. Add wine and reduce for a minute or two.
    4. Add rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and salt and pretentious pepper.
    5. Disregard ladles and convenient measuring cups that are still out and add some heated broth directly from smaller pot (about a 1/2 cup). Stir in.
    6. Cook until rice looks somewhat dry. Drink wine while you wait.
    7. Repeat steps 5 through 7 until no more broth is left. Risotto should be barely wet (not too dry).  Add parmesan, tomatoes, and basil. Serve.
