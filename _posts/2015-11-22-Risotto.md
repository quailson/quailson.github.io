Tonight, my roommate and I made risotto. It was loosely based off of [this recipe from Anson Mills](http://www.ansonmills.com/recipes/406). They describe it as "A side dish that knows no peers," but we wanted a risotto more suitable for dinner plate, so some modifications were made (meaning we just threw in tomatoes and fresh basil at the last second because it felt like a good idea at the time). Here's the recipe. The ingredients are precise because we winged it, like everything else we do in the kitchen.

## Tomato Basil Risotto

    * 4 cups of chicken broth
    * 2 tablespoons of butter
    * around 2 tablespoons of olive oil
    * 3 shallots
    * 3 cloves of garlic
    * 1 cup of rice (we used Carolina Gold, but Arborio should work fine)
    * around 1/2 cup of really cheap Pinot Grigio
    * couple sprigs worth of thyme and rosemary
    * couple bay leaves
    * sea salt to taste (depends on what kind of chicken broth you use)
    * ground black pepper (we had black peppercorns that we're soaked in a port wine)
    * freshly grated parmesan
    * 1 cup of cherry tomatoes
    * 1/2 cup of fresh basil

    1. Pour a glass of wine. Drink.
    2. Heat the stock in a small pot on medium for a bit. Leave it on the side for now.
    3. In a larger pot on medium heat, add butter and minced shallots and garlic. Cook until golden. Add rice and a little olive oil. Stir around for a few minutes.
    4. Add cheap wine and reduce for about a minute or two. Drink wine while it's out.
    5. Add rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and salt and pretentious pepper.
    6. Disregard ladles and convenient measuring cups that are still out and add some heated broth directly from smaller pot (about a 1/2 cup or so). Stir in.
    7. Cook until rice looks dry. Drink wine while you wait.
    8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 until no more broth is left. Add tomatoes and basil.
