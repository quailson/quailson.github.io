(I've updated this since its original post to clarify some thoughts, but keep in mind that there's a lot on here that is not good practice. A new post with a new design and explanation will be up soon.)

We ended up having to redesign the entire PCB because the traces were too small and fab was getting expensive. We used 3 mil traces with 3 mil spacing, thinking it was necessary given the nature of the microcontroller's package. Now we're up to 5 mil with 5 spacing. We're taking some creative freedom with the routing, but it's looking like it will pay off. Via size has also been increased up to 10 mil drills and annular rings. It's much bigger than I originally thought we could design for. We opted to begin routing in our third layer and route power manually. Our stackup is now:

    1. Signal 1
    2. Signal 2
    3. Ground Plane
    4. Signal 3

The main reason I decided to switch was to accommodate the DDR2 section. Most manufacturers recommend at least 6 layers for routing DDR2 and proper termination for all signals, assuming we didn't utilize the On Die Termination (ODT) of the chip. I'd feel much more comfortable with a 6 layer board. It'd be easier to route and would give me peace of mind knowing that the memory traces would all have a solid ground return path. Unfortunately, we didn't have that luxury. We needed to design this so that almost any PCB fabricator could push out 650 on short notice. And also to be within budget. A 6 layer board seemed out of the question.

Another potential problem I saw were the termination resistors we had in place. If we had to use 5 mil traces and keep all of the components on one side of the board (to keep assembly costs down), it would be nearly impossible to route, given the space between pins on the micro. I had been researching how to use the ODT in order to get rid of the resistors for weeks with little to no avail. The AR9331 didn't seem to support controlling it automagically. We even talked about implementing an RC circuit to keep it logically off for only 200 clock cycles. The only way we could remove the resistors effectively would be through physically putting the DDR2 chip close enough to the MCU so that we could ignore transmission line effects. Again, seemed out of the question with our previous design.

This wasn't the only issue. The Signal 2 layer used to be a 3V3 plane, which in this board was unnecessary. Plus, the second layer being a power plane would mean that all the signals on the first layer would not have a solid ground plane underneath them for a proper return path.

Hence the redesign. Having a third signal layer would give us a little more wiggle room for resolving these issues. It gave us the ability to route the 5 mil traces. Now we had a board that even OSH Park could fab. Second, with a little creative placement, we could get the DDR2 close enough to MCU to scrap all the resistors AND give all of the first layer signals a ground pour underneath them.

All of the DDR2 traces could be kept under an inch now, which with kept the wavelength of the signal well below 10% of the trace length. Plus, I was able to keep important data traces closer to the ground plane (and also ground pours in all of the signal layers).

Take that transmission lines.
